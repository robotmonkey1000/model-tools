# Model Tools
A tool to preview and apply custom models from resource packs.

## Usage
1. Hold an item in hand, and press open viewer keybind (J by default).
2. Select the namespace of the resource pack you want to view
3. Select a model from the list:
   1. Ones beginning with *equipment* are for armor and similar models
   2. Ones beginning with *item* are for item models
4. Choose your display type in the top right (Item, Helmet, Etc)

## Setup information
When installed on just the **client** side, you can preview all models currently enabled by active resource packs

When installed on both **Server** and **Client** sides, you can then modify your held item by applying the model to the held item either as a texture model, or an equipment asset.
